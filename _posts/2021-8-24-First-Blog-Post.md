Q1. What do you think being a data scientist is about? What do you see as the major duties and/or knowledge areas?  

I think being a data scientist is about working with massive data, that they apply knowledge of computer science, mathematics, and statistics to problem solving, as well as responsible for interpreting raw data into meaningful information. Data scientists usually analyze, process, and model data then interpret the results to create actionable plans for companies and other organizations.

Q2. What differences/similarities do you see between data scientists and statisticians?  

Both data scientists and statisticians develop solid foundations in statistics. However, while statisticians seems to be more focusing on statistical theories, data scientists interest in datastorytelling. 

Q3. How do you view yourself in relation to these two areas?

I identify myself as a statistician who are interested in learning more of the data science techniques so that I can apply the traditional statistics methods efficiently to large-scale data in real-life problem solving.
